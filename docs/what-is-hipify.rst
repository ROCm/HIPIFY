What is HIPIFY?
********************************************************

HIPIFY is a tool for translating CUDA source into portable HIP C++. To do this, HIPIFY uses:

* :doc:`hipify-clang <./install/hipify-clang.md>`: A clang-based tool that translates CUDA source into an
  abstract syntax tree, which is traversed by transformation matchers. After applying all the matchers, it
  produces the output HIP source.
* :doc:`hipify-perl <./install/hipify-perl.md>`: An autogenerated, perl-based script that relies heavy on
  regular expressions.

As part of PyTorch, the `hipify_torch <https://github.com/ROCm/hipify_torch>`_ tool was created. This
related tool can also translate CUDA source code into portable HIP C++. `hipify_torch` was developed
as part of the PyTorch project in order to satisfy PyTorch's unique needs. It proved useful for
PyTorch-related projects, so was released as its own utility.

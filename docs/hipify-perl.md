# hipify-perl

`hipify-perl` is an autogenerated perl-based script which heavily uses regular expressions.

**Advantages:**

1. Ease of use.

2. It doesn't check the input source CUDA code for correctness.

3. It doesn't have dependencies on 3rd party tools, including CUDA.

**Disadvantages:**

1. Current disability (and difficulty in implementing) of transforming the following constructs:

    * macros expansion;

    * namespaces:

        * redefines of CUDA entities in user namespaces;

        * using directive;

    * templates (some cases);

    * device/host function calls distinguishing;

    * header files correct injection;

    * complicated argument lists parsing.

2. Difficulties in supporting.

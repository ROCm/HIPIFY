[hipify_torch](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/hipify_torch) is a related tool that can also translate CUDA source code into portable HIP C++. It was developed as part of the PyTorch project to satisfy that project's unique needs but was found useful by PyTorch-related projects and thus released as its own utility.
